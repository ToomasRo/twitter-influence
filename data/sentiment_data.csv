2024-01-04,"Does $BTC follow 4 year cycles, or lengthening cycles?

In 2011, 2013 & 2017 we saw a traditional 'blow-off top', but in 2021 we did not. 

If we were to assume that the 'blow-off tops' were in fact the cycle ""highs"" then naturally, we have to assume that #BTC doesn't follow 4 year cycles, but rather lengthening cycles. 

Between 2011 & 2013 there were ~905 days. 

Between 2013 & 2017 there were ~1479 days.

If we assume that the cycles lengthen by the same relative degree each time, that would give us a multiplier of 1.63 (1479 / 905 = 1.63)

1479 (Previous cycle length) * 1.63 = ~2418d

That would make for an estimated blow-off top around the end of July 2024. 

It's an idea that makes a lot of sense to me, especially given 2021's irregular ""topping"" pattern. 

If the halving theorists are to be disillusioned, it seems we will find out in the coming months.

TeleSwap accomplishes this by locking $BTC and utilizing data from the #TeleportDAO light client bridge to mint TeleBTC, a unique, secure, and trustless wrapped BTC.

1‚É£/ Transferring assets between blockchains is often a time-consuming process that introduces risks for users, such as incurring losses when they need to exchange their assets immediately. TeleSwap introduces a bridge mechanism that allows for instant cross-chain settlements.

2‚É£/ In current cross-chain DEXs, users must have native tokens of different chains to pay for the fees of each network, which makes it difficult for users to use them. In #TeleSwap, users pay all fees in the native token of the blockchain they are interacting with, simplifying the user experience.

3‚É£/ Teleswap users can now easily move their $BTC across multiple chains with TeleBTC!

There's also been sales for over 0.14 BTC & 0.16 BTC (+7000 USD) for the rare pieces. This is the highest a piece of his artwork has ever been sold for... YET.

2024-01-06,"Why the @btcordinal Ordinal ecosystem is already worth millions:

Numbers: 
38 Collections
214313 Ordinals
200 MB Blockspace (estimated)
228 BTC or ~10 Million USD MC

Here's a brief overview of the BTC machine collections, their supply, floor price, and market cap - they're about to make history as the Survival Gear reaches 100,000 inscriptions, becoming the largest Ordinals collection - all airdropped for free.

I've counted 38 collections but might have missed some - do you know of any? I'd love to complete the table. I'm also adding Inscription Range, File Size, and Creation Fee. What I can roughly estimate is that the cumulative block space occupied by the BTC Machine collections will be around 200MB.

200MB of block space is already incredibly valuable - it would currently cost 10 trillion Sats or 100 Bitcoin in transaction fees (at 50 sats/vbyte). At the market peak a few weeks ago, we saw fees at 500 sats/vbyte, which would value the 200MB block space at 10 times this amount - 1,000 BTC or 43 million dollars. I'm convinced we'll return to these fees and even surpass them, so inscribing as much as you can now at these rates seems like a remarkably smart move by @papozorus and @Mr_Lucky777_ that will make history.

It's worth noting that most of these assets are already playable, or will soon be in the only Bitcoin MMORPG - Satoria - to date. And let's be honest - if someone doesn't start inscribing hundreds of thousands of assets for their own game soon - which, given the similar size and comparatively low fees, would now cost millions - it's likely to remain the sole Bitcoin MMORPG.

I know I haven't included Zbit in my analysis - I'll be discussing ZBIT and why you should consider having some in a longer tweet in the coming days/weeks, along with the File Size/Creation Fee of each collection. @LeonidasNFT Please add the missing collections to @ord_io  - it would immensely help me in figuring out their precise sizes and creation fees. Nonetheless @ord_io has been tremendously helpful in collecting the current data - it's an amazing site. Keep it up!

Fun fact: the collections are worth at least 2-3 Bitcoin, just for the Satoshis contained within them, which is already over 100k dollars - and that's only considering the UTXOs - that range between 330 and 10,000 sats - in the BTC Machine collections. 
People coming from other chains might find this hard to grasp - besides the fact that Ordinals in your wallet genuinely belong to you and can't be altered, there will always be this minimum value. This value might seem insignificant now, but in the future, it could be quite substantial.

I deeply regret not having inscribed my own art onto the blockchain much earlier. I really hope we see fees drop below 10 sats/vbyte again, or even lower - but I can't believe the mempool will ever clear again.

Regardless, one can always have regrets - and hope for lower fees too. In any case, I will continue to follow BTC Machine on its journey and am excited to see what comes next. 

Don't forget to tell me if I missed a collection. Also would love to hear which collections you already own or which you are planing to buy. Do you think the collections are already fair valued?

Cheers and out.",ValarianBTC,2797,28,46,91,btc,positive,0.5007026791572571,5,1,5,11,0.94231116771698,0.9399475455284119,0.7629600644111634,131.0,111.0,69.4,43967.9,-0.43

15 years ago today, Satoshi mined Bitcoin Block 9 and received 5 billion sats as the reward.

He then sent 1 billion of those sats to Hal Finney in the first BTC transaction ever.

For 14 years those Block 9 sats were spread throughout the Bitcoin network until May of last year when sat hunter @null_ish found some and was the first to inscribe on them.

Since then notable projects such as @OrdinalMaxiBiz, @OnChainMonkey, and many more have chosen to inscribe their collections exclusively on them.

We index all inscriptions on Block 9 sats in the order they were created via @ord_io. You can view this history here:

900 Bitcoin are issued daily, and you can see Blackrock's move into their cash supply from last night into Bitcoin, buying the dip. Now, they mostly hold Bitcoin.

The key point is 11,500 BTC were sucked from the system in 2 days by 1 player.

That alone is approximately 13 days of supply.

In addition, IBIT Spot ETF only managed an average of 25% of the volume over two days - so we can assume 46K in 2 days was sucked out (yeah, I know $GBTC impacted this). ¬†Net net, if this pace continues, we're facing a severe supply crunch.

Assuming 11,500 x 4 = 46,000 or 23,000 per day, that's 25.56 times the daily production consumed by US ETFs per day alone... forget about retail investors, other global ETFs etc.

Ignore the price fluctuations; this asset is incredibly hard, and if this continues, we will face an extreme supply crunch. #Bitcoin ETF launch was a huge success (despite egregious GBTC fees)",invest_answers,259510,414,1155,5690,btc,neutral,0.6566442847251892,6,4,10,20,0.8367960850397745,0.6026913076639175,0.6800745755434037,87.16666666666667,154.5,201.4,42851.3,0.04

2024-01-15,"Can you have too much #Bitcoin? 

The answer is an unequivocal ""Yes!"" You CAN have too much #btc and here are the signs that you may have too much at the current moment.

You have too much #BTC when:

1) Your quality of life has deteriorated to the point where the USD price has you super stressed at all times, you can't sleep and you are generally miserable all the time;

2) A downward movement of 20% to 30% makes you feel as though your whole life is over and you start entertaining thoughts that #btc is a farce;

3) The downward USD prices cause you to quickly sell, in order to wait for lower prices; 

4) You start following crypto bros and YouTube influencers each day in search of instructions and  guidance on what to do with your #btc; 

5) You have zero cash to live your ordinary life. Note: Many Bitcoiners disagree with me on this one, but I'll hold my ground on this. #BTC is the world's greatest saving technology. It is not yet the world's greatest spending technology. We still need dirty cash for our daily lives. Having the appropriate amount of cash on hand to live your life normally without causing your family to suffer just because your profile picture suddenly has laser eyes is more than ok, it's intelligence. My 2 sats.

At the end of the day, if what we believe to be true about #Bitcoin and its potential has merit, having a truck load is simply not necessary. What is more necessary is that you hold on to what you have without selling it. That to me is more important than the quantity, especially at the start of your journey. 

Lastly, as your understanding about and conviction in #Bitcoin grows, you'll only up your comfort level and go for more and more and more. That is what happened to me. I hope this helps. #stackharder",olvelez007,56957,98,71,649,btc,negative,0.5730888247489929,9,4,7,20,0.7432358662287394,0.6274438351392746,0.6705297231674194,153.0,127.75,139.28571428571428,42510.7,1.83

Today was an amazing day because True Northüí´ after 1000s of hours of perfecting it, finally began to mint.
(Check it out on Magic Eden)

Also, I had the privilege and honor in welcoming many new members to MasterPassüí´.

It's an amazing feeling when people desire Art I created, it's almost indescribable.
To see the excitement is incredibly fulfilling an heartwarming.

I was reminded today of what my Art History Professor told me while studying abroad in Italy.
""There are only 2 things truly created in this world, Art and Babies""
Truth.

The greatest joy was the excitement that came when MasterPass Members were picking their colors. 
All of them had difficulty in picking the one that captured their heart‚ù§Ô∏è

A testament to the unique beauty of every 1/1 in the 88 piece Collection.
A Fine Dynamic Art Ordinal Collection inscribed on 450x Block9

I love how I am seeing a subtle shift in the attention that Fine Art is getting on Ordinals. I welcome it, I embrace it, it's desperately needed.

True Northüí´ is just a small taste of all that MasterPass will bring, in Art, Value, and Experience.

I'm so glad be apart of the Fellowship we now share.

MasterWorksüí´ will never stop creating the Highest Quality Advanced Digital Artifacts and Inscribing them only on 450x Block9 Sats.

True Northüí´ will be minting for the next 48 hours.
